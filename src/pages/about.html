        <h2>What is Montessori Education?</h2>
        <p>Montessori education is a child-centered educational approach based on scientific observations of children from birth to adulthood. It was developed by Dr. Maria Montessori in the early 1900s. The Montessori method encourages children to learn at their own pace in a prepared environment that promotes independence, freedom within limits, and respect for a child’s natural psychological, physical, and social development.</p>
